# FDA CLIA Database

## FDA Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Database

### Overview

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 provide the authority for certification and oversight of clinical labs and lab testing. Clinical labs are required to have the appropriate certificate granted by CLIA before accepting human samples for testing. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the FDA, and the CDC are responsible for administering the CLIA program. CMS is responsible for issuing lab certificates and enforcing regulatory lab compliance. The FDA reviews requests for CLIA waiver applications and is responsible for categorizing tests based on complexity (FDA CLIA database). The CDC develops technical standards and guidelines for improving the quality of lab tests.


### FDA CLIA Database

The FDA CLIA database contains records of all commercially marketed lab tests that have been categorized by CLIA. The database is updated monthly and can be searched by a variety of filters, such as Test System/Manufacturer, Analyte Name, Complexity, Specialty, and Date of Categorization. The categorization of tests prior to February 2000 was conducted by the CDC and has since been done by the FDA.

### Categorization
The tests are categorized by three levels of complexity: Waived, Moderate Complexity, and High Complexity. Tests categorized as waived have been cleared or approved or home use. Tests that are determined to be too complex for home use are either categorized as having moderate or high complexity. This separation is then determined by the following criteria scoreboard:


   1. Knowledge required to conduct the test
   2. Training and experience required to conduct the test
   3. Reagents and materials needed​
   4. Characteristics of steps​
   5. Calibration and quality control needed​
   6. Test troubleshooting and equipment maintenance
   7. Interpretation and judgement needed


The test system is scored from 1-3 in each of these criteria and based on the total score is either categorized as having moderate or high complexity. Uncategorized tests are defaulted to a high complexity until categorized. Tests receiving a moderate complexity are eligible to request waived categorization through a submission of the CLIA Waiver by Application (CW).

### Downloadable Data

The available CLIA data for download includes a file of in vitro test systems categorized as far back as 1993. The dataset contains 25,712 records up to the year 2000 and 75,058 records up to present day. As far as I have been able to find, these are the only CLIA database files available for download. However, it is not specified whether these files represent the complete set of test systems in the database. The download links for these records are provided below.

For more detailed information about the categorized tests, such as the applicant contact details, FDA 510(k) submission information, and a summary letter of the FDA’s decision, you will need to visit the FDA database page. The downloadable CLIA data files are formatted to provide a more concise overview of the approved test system. While the files may not offer extensive details, I believe they remain a reliable source for gathering information on thousands of analytes, many of which are used across hundreds if not thousands of test systems. 

In total, the 100,770 downloadable CLIA test system records cover approximately 1,183 distinct analytes. The word “approximately” is used because, due to my limited chemistry and medical knowledge, I am unsure if analytes — such as “Cystacin C” and “Cystatin C” —refer to different proteins or if typographical errors occurred during data entry. This is one example of potential discrepancies, and I cannot yet confirm whether more exist.
